This example demonstrates integration of the [Oculus SDK](http://developer.oculus.com/) into Magnum.

Notes
-----

This example requires you to have the Oculus Runtime 0.6.0.0-beta installed. Since Oculus
only supports Windows, the same holds for the example.

If you don't own a hmd, you can still try the example. If no device is connected, it will
create a debug hmd instead.
