=============================

Contains two *Star Wars*-like characters and some other garbage. Playing with

 * FPS-like interaction using **arrow keys** and **mouse movement**.
 * You can fling the sword with **left mouse button**.
 * **End key** toggles mouse grabbing so you can exit the game (but you
   shouldn't).
