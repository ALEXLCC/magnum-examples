Bug reports, feature requests or code contributions are always very welcome.
To make things easier, here are a few tips:

Reporting bugs, requesting features
-----------------------------------

- Best way to report bugs and request new features is to use GitHub
  [issues](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues), but you can
  contact me also any other way.

Code contribution
-----------------

- Building and installing Magnum and related projects is described in the
  [documentation](http://mosra.cz/blog/magnum-doc/building.html).
- Follow the project coding guidelines. In short - try to match style of
  surrounding code and avoid any trailing whitespace. When in doubt, consult
  coding guidelines, which are available also
  [online](http://mosra.cz/blog/magnum-doc/coding-style.html).
- Document your code. When updating or adding new examples, make sure that
  Doxygen documentation is up to date. Run

      doxygen

  in root of Magnum project to generate the documentation and check that your
  modifications didn't add any warnings.
- Best way to contribute is by using GitHub
  [pull requests](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pulls) - fork the
  repository and make pull request from feature branch. You can also send
  patches via e-mail or contact me any other way.
- All your code will be released under license of the project, so make sure
  you (or your employers) have no problems with it.
